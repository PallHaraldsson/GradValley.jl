### ATTENTION, IMPORTANT INFORMATION: THIS REPOSITORY IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION, IT IS NOT READY FOR USE YET!

GradValley.jl is a new lightweight module for deep learning in 100% Julia. It offers a high level interface for model building and training. It is completely independent from other machine learning packages like [Flux](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl), [Knet](https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl), [NNlib](https://github.com/FluxML/NNlib.jl) or [NNPACK](https://github.com/Maratyszcza/NNPACK). It is based on Julia's standard array type and needs no additional tensor type. To get started, see Installation and First steps. See the models folders or the Tutorials page in the Wiki for examples.

The Wiki page of this repository provides a documentation for the GradValley.jl software package. Further Tutorials can be also found there.
