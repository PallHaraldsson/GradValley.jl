## Detailed introduction to Machine Learning 

Go to the article (Pluto-Notebook): [www.jst-projekte.de/einfuehrung-ml/](https://www.jst-projekte.de/einfuehrung-ml/)

Note that the article is written in German. However, with today's translation tools built into browsers, it is easy to translate it into English, for example.

The article (Pluto notebook) entitled "An interactive introduction to Machine Learning" gives a detailed introduction to the most important concepts of Machine Learning. 
Including e.g. data sets, machine learning models, weight initialization and training of machine learning models (optimization using loss functions and gradient descent). 
The entire article is based on an example that uses Machine Learning to solve a non-linear [regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) problem. 
Because the article was written using [Pluto-Notebooks](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), it offers a lot of interactive functionalities. For example, you can change the learning using a slider rate and all the other code cells using the adjusted learning rate will update automatically! 
To use the interactive features, you have to download the Pluto-Notebook (click on the button "Edit or run this notebook" in the upper right corner of [the article](https://www.jst-projekte.de/einfuehrung-ml/)) and run it on your local system (the [Pluto package](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) must be installed of course).

The article was written by Jonas Steinebach, the main author of GradValley and its documentation.
